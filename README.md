## Overview

This is the repository of [Kurbanali Ruslan](https://kurr.dev) portfolio.

Initially project made with plain JavaScript, Webpack and Three.js back in 2019. This project originates from that time with some updates and improvements.

Current stack of the project: [React](https://react.dev/), [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [React-Three-Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction), [GSAP](https://gsap.com/), [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction).

## Getting Started

### Installation

```shell
# Clone git repository
git clone https://github.com/kurrx/kurr.dev.git
cd kurr.dev

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run start
```

### Configuration

You can change information about yourself in `.env` file.

Music files are stored in `public/musics` directory. You can add your own musics to this directory. Also don't forget to update information about musics in `src/assets/index.ts` file. Respect intellectual property of others, credit music authors, do not use copyrighted music.

### Tweaking

Add [`#debug`](https://kurr.dev#debug) to url to enter Tweak Mode (Mockup Mode on dev server). This will show (hide on dev server) **Debug Menu** and **Performance Monitor** of 3D Scene. You can change settings and see the changes in real-time.

## WIP

This is not final shape of this project, it's still work in progress. I'm planning to add more features and improvements in the future. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Currently I'm planning to add:

- About page
- Projects showcase
- Performance improvements
